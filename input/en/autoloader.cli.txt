Title: CLI commands
SeeAlso:
 - conventions.cli

---

The autoloader provides only one CLI command: `opl:autoloader:build-class-map`. It takes a single argument, which is the path to the INI file with the map configuration. The INI file contains the necessary data required to generate a proper map. Its structure is shown in the following listing:

~~~~
[ini]
[config]
; Where the map should be stored
outputFile = "./config/classMap.txt"

; The recognized file extension
extension = ".php"

[namespaces]
Opl = "./src/"
Symfony = "./src/"
~~~~

In the `namespaces` sections, we specify all the top-level namespaces and filesystem paths that should be scanned for PHP classes.

Example call:

~~~~
[console]
$ php cli.php opl:autoloader:build-class-map ../path/to/classMap.ini
~~~~

Adding the commands to the CLI
==============================

Open Power Libs does not provide its own command-line interface. Instead, it provides some commands that can be used to build one. The details concerning installing the commands in the CLI application are described in the [Command-line interface][conventions.cli] chapter. The example below shows, how to install `opl:autoloader:build-class-map`:

~~~~
[php]
$cli->addCommands(array(
	new \Opl\Autoloader\Command\ClassMapBuild(),
));
~~~~
