Title: Open Power Autoloader

---

**Open Power Autoloader** is a collection of universal class loaders for PHP 5.3+ with additional management tools. They handle [PSR-0](http://groups.google.com/group/php-standards/web/psr-0-final-proposal) class naming standard which has been recently adapted by many mainstream PHP projects. A single standard improves interoperability and allows OPA to support such projects, as Symfony 2 or Doctrine without any problems. The opposite relationship is also true - you can use autoloaders from these projects to load OPL code.

The autoloaders provided by this package have been designed to achieve the biggest possible performance. In modern PHP applications, class loading has a critical influence on speed. Even if we use opcode caching, such as [APC](http://docs.php.net/apc), the autoloader must still translate the class name to the filesystem path. For projects with a greater number of classes, the parser can spend up to the 50% of the overall execution time in the autoloader code, so proper optimization in this place can give us a significant boost.
