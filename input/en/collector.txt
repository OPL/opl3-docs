Title: Open Power Collector

---

In a typical web application there are many components that want to share some data to the other parts of the system. The most obvious case is the system configuration - a set of values loaded from a file or database which determines the way the application works. **Open Power Collector** provides a generic data collector that can be used for various purposes. It supports nested value sets, caching and loading the data from different sources. By default, the library provides some general-purpose data loaders that allow you to build a configuration system and a user request data collector. However, it is very easy to extend the library with custom loaders, adapting it to new situations.

Open Power Collector is also the default configuration system for other projects from the OPL foundation. You will certainly meet it every time you configure any OPL project.
