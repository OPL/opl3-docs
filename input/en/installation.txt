Title: Installation

---

In this chapter, we describe, how to install Open Power Libs projects in your development environment. There are three different ways for this:

* manual installation,
* PHAR archives,
* PEAR installation.

Component dependency diagram
============================

The component diagram below shows the dependencies between OPL libraries and third party components. You can use it to check whether you have installed everything you need for proper work.

Installation procedure
======================

Before installing Open Power Libs 3, please ensure that you understand [PSR-0](http://groups.google.com/group/php-standards/web/psr-0-final-proposal) class naming standard, because it is very important to the project file organization.

Manual installation
-------------------

We assume that your project directory tree contains some `/lib` or `/src` directory, where we can store libraries and (typically) the framework source code.

1. download the archive from [www.invenzzia.org](http://www.invenzzia.org),
2. extract the downloaded archive somewhere,
3. copy the `/src/Opl` directory from the downloaded archive to the `/src/Opl` directory in your project directory tree,
4. configure the autoloader (see below).

This is the basic installation that would allow you to run the downloaded code. Note that other libraries may require some additional steps here.

PHAR installation
-----------------

Open Power Libs 3 can be also downloaded as a single, self-contained PHAR archive. Just put it somewhere in your project directory and configure the autoloader to load the `Opl` namespace from that archive.

PEAR installation
-----------------

Open Power Libs 3 libraries can be also installed via PEAR installer:

~~~~
[console]
pear channel-discover pear.invenzzia.org
pear install OPL_Libraryname
~~~~

After installing the libraries, you must configure the autoloader in your project to load OPL classes.

Configuring autoloaders
=======================

Once we have successfully copied the files, we must configure some autoloader. Open Power Libs will work with any autoloader compatible with [PSR-0](http://groups.google.com/group/php-standards/web/psr-0-final-proposal) standard, so you do not have to install or use **Open Power Autoloader**. The libraries share the same top-level namespace: `Opl`, and the same primary directory - you just have to configure the path to that namespace and it should handle properly any OPL library installed later.

A sample configuration for the `SplClassLoader`:

~~~~
[php]
$symfonyLoader = new SplClassLoader('Symfony', '/path/to/src');
$symfonyLoader->register();

$oplLoader = new SplClassLoader('Opl', '/path/to/src');
$oplLoader->register();
~~~~

A sample configuration for the OPL generic autoloader:

~~~~
[php]
require('../src/Opl/Autoloader/GenericLoader.php');
$loader = new Opl\Autoloader\GenericLoader('\\', '../src');
// 'Opl' is in ../src
$loader->addLibrary('Opl');
// 'Symfony' is in ../src too.
$loader->addLibrary('Symfony');
$loader->register();
~~~~
